# Gradle Based Configuration of IntelliJ IDEA #


This examples configures the setting that I care about in a gradle project, setting code style, gradle and inspection preferences.  Preferences are mostly focused on Java, JavaScript and Groovy code.

## Usage ##

Copy these files into your target project, then:

```gradle
apply from: "gradle/idea.gradle"
```
